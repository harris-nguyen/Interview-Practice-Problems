// Brief: Create some simple classes or reusable objects to implement a deck of playing cards. Each card has a suit and a rank. Possible suits are Hearts, Diamonds, Spades and Clubs. Possible ranks are 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, Jack, Queen, King and Ace. The deck should be initialized with 52 cards -- one of each of the 13 ranks in each suit.

// Use either JavaScript or Java. Use real syntax (not pseudocode).

// Talking out loud and explaining your thought process is encouraged
