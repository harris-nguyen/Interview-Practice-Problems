// Object Oriented are based on the concept of objects
// Attributes or properties
// funtions or methods

// Object Oriented
// - Abstraction
// - Polymorph
// - Encapsulation
// - Inheritance

//!! Each class represents an object which has its own methods //!!

// Object Oriented

// - Abstraction
//     - Exposing only what is needed for the user to see. For example: Imagine a DVD player. You have buttons you can see but all the methods
//       are behind the scenes
//     - Simpler interface
//     - Reduces the impact of change
//         - When changes are made, it will not affect anything outside of scope
//     - Only show the neccessary detail to the user (buttons)
//         - Only care about calling the method but not the underline how things work inside

// - Inheritance
//     - Gives you the power to reuse and can add to it
//     - Allows you to eliminate redundant code
//     - Inherit other objects, methods
//     -! classes that are derived from an existing class are called:
          // SUBCLASS
          // EXTENDED class
          // CHILD CLASS
        // These can be used by using extends
       // ^ where these sub classes came from are known as:
          // SUPER CLASS
          // PARENT class
          // BASE class

// - Polymorph (many forms)
//     - Git rid of long if and else or switch statements
//     - Determines what should run while the program is running
//       - figurs out during runtime. looks at what object it is pointed to then
//         looks at the method and if it's overwritten, it'll call the child object

//  - Encapsulation (the action of enclosing something in or as if in a capsule)
//    - Built on the idea of data hiding
  //  - Same idea as scope?
  //  - Able to restrict access to whatever is calling that object
  //  - A group of relatable variables and functions into an unit/object
  //  - We refer to the variables as properties
  //  - We refer functions as methods
  //  - Encapsulating our PROPERTIES within the object
// ï¿¼

// Procedural Programming
// - Divides a program into different functions
// - Cons of this is that if you make one change to one function, other functions will break
// - You have to create a lot of functions or even copy same code

// Benefits:
// - Encapsulation: reduce complexity + increase reusability
// - Abstraction: Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
// - Inheritance: Eliminate redundant code
// - Encapsulation: Refactor ugly switch/case statements
