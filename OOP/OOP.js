// Object Oriented
// - Encapsulation
// - Abstraction
// - Inheritance
// - Polymorph

//!! Each class represents an object which has its own methods //!!

// Procedural Programming
// - Divides a program into different functions
// - Cons of this is that if you make one change to one function, other functions will break
// - You have to create a lot of functions or even copy same code

// Benefits:
// - Encapsulation: reduce complexity + increase reusability
// - Abstraction: Reduce complexity + isolate impact of changes
// - Inheritance: Eliminate redundant code
// - Encapsulation: Refactor ugly switch/case statements

// Object Oriented
// - Encapsulation:
// - Data hiding?
// - Same idea as scope?
// - Able to restrict access to whatever is calling that object
// - A group of relatable variables and functions into an unit/object
// - We refer to the variables as properties
// - We refer functions as methods
// ï¿¼

// - Abstraction
//     - Imagine a DVD player. You have buttons you can see but all the methods or behind the scene work is left unseen
//     - Simpler interface
//     - Reduces the impact of change
//         - When changes are made, it will not affect anything outside of scope
//     - Only show the neccessary detail to the user (buttons)
//         - Only care about calling the method but not the underline how things work inside
// - Inheritance
//     - Allows you to eliminate redundant code
//     - Inherit other objects, methods
//     - Gives you the power to reuse and can add to it
// - Polymorph (many forms)
//     - Git rid of long if and else or switch statements
//     - Determines what should run while the program is running
