// The Promise object represents the eventual completion (or failure) of an asynchronous operation and its resulting value.
  // pending: initial state, neither fulfilled nor rejected.
  // fulfilled: meaning that the operation was completed successfully.
  // rejected: meaning that the operation failed.

// why are promises better than callbacks
  // Promises are asynchronous callbacks. They can't do anything that callbacks can't do, and you face the same problems
  // with asynchrony as with plain callbacks. However, Promises are more than just callbacks. ...
  // Instead of expecting callbacks as arguments to your functions, you can easily return a Promise object
